            <h2>About Jason.</h2>
            <div class="letter">
              <p> I’m a designer, developer, and Drupalist— living just north of Chicago. </p>
              <p> I have worn a number of hats in my career, from creative director to web designer to front-end
                developer. As my interests have evolved, my design background has been a huge asset moving into a
                full-time digital role. </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Designer.</strong>
                <br> I have a passion for the practice of design. Initially I was focused on traditional design and
                identity work, but began designing for the web back when Dreamweaver was the tool of choice. These days,
                I’m focused on providing clients with design systems and creating dynamic user experiences that support
                client brands and objectives. I believe, that if designers want to be taken seriously we need to
                understand our client’s business goals in order to provide them with smart design solutions. </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Developer.</strong>
                <br>As my focus turned to web design, understanding the tools and function of a website became key to
                planning and building dynamic user experiences. At some point I was hooked on making sure my design was
                translated to the screen correctly. My toolkit as a front-end developer is constantly changing to meet
                the challenges of my latest project. You can get a lot done with HTML, SASS and some javascript. But
                incorporating new technology and frameworks is a challenge I embrace! </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Drupalist.</strong>
                <br> My first Drupal site was a freelance project, which required learning Drupal 5 from a book over a
                weekend. Modules, views, content types and blocks— it was all new to me. At some point, I was hooked.
                With Drupal 8, I like to keep things as light as possible. Relying on a few key modules, some Twig
                template work and a Bootstrap based theme. My design thinking informs everything from the public facing
                theme, to customizing the admin UI for site editors.</p>
              <p> I am currently looking to work with amazing people and companies. Focused on finding a role where I
                can leverage my experience, talent and skills to solving client’s business problems. While being a
                valuable contributor to an organization and its culture. </p>
              <p>Thank you for visiting. If you would like to learn more about me, or chat about working together,
                please reach out.</p>

                However, the project had stalled and was in need of serious guidance, from UI/UX design, structure

            <p class="mb-5 col-lg-12"> As a first step, the design team presented several approaches to stakeholders for
              making the site visually cohesive and easier to navigate. This included using the Erikson brand colors as
              a way finding tool, defining a design system with color treatments for imagery, a splash of iconography to
              highlight key messaging, and great typography.</p>

              <p> The developer had already done a great job of migrating content and setting up the Wordpress backend.
                So once the UI/UX was defined, we focused on working with the client to implement content changes,
                reorganizing page structures, refining the site theme, as well as coordinating with the development team
                to pull everything together for launch. It was a huge endeavor, but a great success. </p>
